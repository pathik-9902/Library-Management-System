# Library Management System

This Java application allows users to manage a library by adding, searching, checking out, and returning books. Book details are saved to a file.

## Features
- **Add a Book**: Input the book's title and author to add it to the library.
- **Search Books**: Search for books by entering a keyword. Matching results are displayed.
- **Check Out a Book**: Borrow a book by specifying its title, if available.
- **Return a Book**: Return a checked-out book by specifying its title.

## How to Use
1. Compile: `javac LibraryManagementSystem.java`
2. Run: `java LibraryManagementSystem`
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the system.
4. Enter `0` to exit.

## File Storage
Books are stored in `library.txt` in a comma-separated format (title, author, checkout status). Modify the code to change the file name or location.

## Notes
This is a basic version and can be expanded with additional features like user authentication or database integration.
